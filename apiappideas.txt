Cocktails app idea

using absolute drinks API,

finds drink with commmon ingrediants,

if say (drink had 3 common ingrediants), 
{then find ALL drinks with same ingrediants}

if (there are additional ingrediants to the cocktails which have same core ingrediants)

{then print "If you had THIS ingrediant, you could make x cocktail"}

example

Mojito 

35ml white rum -
25ml lime juice - 
15ml sugar syrup - 
mint leaves

muddle with crushed ice, in cooler glass top with soda water and crushed ice cap.

mint for garnish.

Daiquiri

35ml white rum -
25ml lime juice -
15ml sugar syrup -

shake and strain in to coupette glass

Say if you entered the Daiquiri drink for example in to the app, then Mojito could be recommended if the user had the mint leaves. 
As the 3 ingrediants in common are the same, (white rum, lime juice, sugar syrup)
